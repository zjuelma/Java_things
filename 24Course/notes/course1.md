- camelCase:
    - first letter of each word is capitalized except the first word
    - e.g. camelCase, myVariableName, myFirstJavaClass
- PascalCase:
    - first letter of each word is capitalized including the first word
    - e.g. PascalCase, MyVariableName, MyFirstJavaClass

    - words are separated by underscores
    - e.g. snake_case, my_variable_name, my_first_java_class
